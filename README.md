# Pewlett- Hackward Analysis

## Overview 

To determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

1. To better analyze the data I would suggest that PH complete an additional analysis on a yearly basis when the employees will be retiring. I think this will give PH a better overall number as to how many mentors would also be availiable based off the employees that are retiring. Also possibly requiring employees that are retiring to provide 6 months to 1 year advance notice so they can plan ahead so they are not short staffed.

2. If PH refactors this code and filters by the years they will be able to see the amout of mentors that would be avaliable each year. This would help with future plans for the mentor program.

3. By using the ERD you are able to get a better overview of what areas should be linked to get a better overview of the data you are looking to analysis. Having all of this information allows the project to go smooth and be completed with great accuracy.

## Summary

Below you will see my analysis on how many rolls that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

The figure below shows how many roles will need to be filled in each Department between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955

Pewlett Hackward will be looking to fill over 90k roles.

Based off of my analysis on the mentorship program PH is looking to launch I do not think there will be enough mentors to train the next generation at PW. Being that over 90k employees will be retiring between 1952 and 1955 PH will only have 1940 employees that are eligible for the mentor program.

I think the only way the program could be successful is if PH offered group mentoring for the next generation. I would suggest possibly doing a mentor program for 90 days with each group. Also, after the first year of the program PH can go back to the drawing board and see what employees would be eligible for the program the following year.
